Diffusion MRI from **67 healthy controls (ages 7–63 years)** to study white-matter maturation with **NODDI** (neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging), alongside standard **DTI** metrics. The release includes multi-shell HARDI (two shells), single-shell DTI, and T1-weighted anatomical images suitable for ROI- and voxel-wise analyses of **neurite density (ND)**, **orientation dispersion (OD)**, and conventional diffusion indices. Subsets include **test-retest** sessions for reliability assessment. Findings reported in the companion article show ND rising with a logarithmic pattern across childhood to adulthood, OD increasing exponentially later in life, and NODDI measures predicting age more specifically than DTI.

## Dataset details
- **Participants:** 67 healthy controls, 7–63 years; includes **test-retest** subsets.  
- **Modalities:**  
  - **DTI:** single-shell diffusion (b≈1000 s/mm²).  
  - **HARDI (×2):** multi-shell diffusion for **NODDI** modeling.  
  - **Anatomical:** T1-weighted MRI.  
- **Intended uses:** lifespan modeling of ND/OD, age prediction, reliability benchmarking, comparison of **NODDI vs. DTI**.
