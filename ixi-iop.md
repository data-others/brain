# **IXI Dataset (Institute of Psychiatry)**
The **IXI Dataset** provides nearly **600 MRI scans from normal, healthy subjects**, collected as part of the **Information eXtraction from Images (IXI)** project ([EPSRC GR/S21533/02](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=GR/S21533/02)).

## Dataset Description

Each subject underwent a standardized MRI protocol including:

- **T1-weighted images**
- **T2-weighted images**
- **PD-weighted images**
- **Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)**
- **Diffusion-weighted images (15 directions)**

MRI data were collected at three hospitals in London:

| Hospital | Scanner | Field Strength |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Hammersmith Hospital | Philips | 3T |
| Guy’s Hospital | Philips | 1.5T |
| Institute of Psychiatry | GE | 1.5T |
