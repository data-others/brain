# **DTI Predicts Mandarin Learning**
This dataset contains **diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)** data and corresponding **behavioral learning measures** from a study examining how white matter microstructure predicts success in learning Mandarin Chinese as a second language.  
Each subject’s dataset includes **nifti-formatted DWI volumes**, **b-values**, and **b-vectors**, along with a separate CSV file containing demographic and learning performance information.

The dataset accompanies the publication:  
Qi Z., Han M., Garel K., Chen E. S., & Gabrieli J. D. E. (2014). *White-matter structure in the right hemisphere predicts Mandarin Chinese learning success.* *Journal of Neurolinguistics*, 33, 14–28.

## Purpose

This dataset supports research into the **neurobiological basis of second language learning**, with an emphasis on **white matter connectivity and diffusion anisotropy** as predictors of individual learning outcomes.  
It is useful for validating DTI-based biomarkers of language aptitude and for developing new analytic frameworks linking **microstructural brain features** to **language learning performance**.
