This repository hosts the **NTU‑90 diffusion MRI dataset**, comprising 90 subjects scanned on a Siemens 3 T Trio using a diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) protocol (203 directions, b‑max=6000 s/mm²) with 3 mm isotropic resolution and a one‑subject 2 mm DSI scan (b‑max=4000 s/mm²). Data have been converted to NIfTI for broad compatibility.
