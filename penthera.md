The acquisitions were done by the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab in 2016. Thirteen young and healthy subjects (three women and ten men, mean of 25.92 (+-1.85) years old) were scanned six times: two sessions with three scans per session. The DWI (112x112 matrix, TR 5615 ms, TE 95 ms, SENSE factor of 2) were acquired on a 3 Tesla MRI (Philips, Ingenia) with a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence having 3 different shells, b=300, 1000, 2000 mm2/s with respectively 8, 32 and 60 directions distributed, 7 b=0 mm2/s for a total of 107 images and a 2 mm isotropic spatial resolution. A reversed phase encoded b=0 image is available, to correct EPI distortions, with the same spatial resolution as the DWI. The T1-weighted MPRAGE image (TR 7.9 ms, TE 3.5 ms) has a 1mm isotropic spatial resolution.
