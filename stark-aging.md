This dataset includes **behavioral and neuroimaging data from approximately 120 participants aged 18 to 89 years**, collected as part of a research grant focused on understanding the effects of aging on the **hippocampus** and its relationship to **age-related cognitive decline**.

The project combines **high-resolution imaging techniques** with advanced behavioral assessments to provide insights into structural and functional brain changes across the lifespan.

> **Note:** Some, but not all, of the data are currently live. Additional data will be uploaded as time and storage capacity allow.
