This repository hosts the **Multi‑Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource **, a publicly available collection of scan–rescan MRI sessions on 21 healthy volunteers acquired on a 3 T scanner using a standardized one‑hour multi‑parametric protocol. It comprises structural (MPRAGE, FLAIR), diffusion (DTI), functional (resting‑state fMRI), field‑mapping (B0/B1), perfusion (ASL, VASO), quantitative relaxometry (T1, T2), and magnetization transfer imaging, all converted to NIfTI format. This dataset is intended for statisticians and imaging scientists to benchmark and quantify reproducibility across diverse MRI modalities.

## Overview
The Multi‑Modal MRI Reproducibility Resource provides scan–rescan imaging sessions of 21 healthy volunteers (no history of neurological disease) acquired within a clinically feasible 60‑minute protocol on a 3 T MRI scanner. It serves as a gold standard for evaluating reproducibility and power analyses in structural, functional, and microstructural imaging methods.

## Imaging Protocol
- **Structural:** MPRAGE, FLAIR  
- **Diffusion:** DTI (30+ directions)  
- **Functional:** Resting‑state fMRI  
- **Field Maps:** B0 and B1 acquisitions  
- **Perfusion:** ASL, VASO  
- **Relaxometry & MT:** Quantitative T1, T2, and magnetization transfer imaging  

All data were originally in Philips PAR/REC format and have been converted to NIfTI for broad compatibility.

This structure facilitates targeted analysis pipelines for each modality.
